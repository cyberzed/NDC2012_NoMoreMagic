===================

Getting tired of adding services via “Add service reference”?  
Annoyed by the fact that the configurations are so hidden and easy to forget?  
Wish you could be a little bit more in control of your service channels?  

Now there is the option to have it all solved, enter Service Stack, giving you the power back but doesn’t set you back to the days of the *.asmx.
With Service Stack you get the power of controlling what should be flowing in your application, e.g. no more boxing to ObservableCollection just to push data over the web.  
With Service Stack you don’t actually have to spend much time worrying if you need to support other serializers, most frequent used are in the box.  
This session will show you how easy it can be to regain power of your networking layer, and how little code it actually requires.  

Last but not least, how easy RESTfull services can be.
